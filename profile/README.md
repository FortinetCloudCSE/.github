## TECWorkshop Creation Status - currently MVP1.0 
### (CI/CD pipeline w/ FortiDevSec, container for development and publishing)
1. Our "101-getting started" and most-complete guide is here: https://fortinetcloudcse.github.io/UserRepo
   - Following this will get you going with everything you need for a very good MVP1
2. We're working to consolidate and standardize all of our CSE content into this GH Organization: https://github.com/FortinetCloudCSE
   - Front/home readme page is live and WIP.  Many of the specific solutions link to various legacy GH accounts temporarily, until they get fully consolidated here 
   - Documentation and readme's are being updated continuously
3. TEC Workshop Creation process documented here: https://github.com/FortinetCloudCSE/UserRepo

## TEC Workshop Revision History

- MVP 1.1 - currently in dev
  - reduce container size (likely Alpine or BusyBox)
  - add auto Hugo publish via GitHub action
  - eliminate need to store Huho Built static site (/public or /docs folder)
- **MVP 1.0 - current**
  - Separated UserRepo and Central Repo to allow maximum re-usability & future-proofing for style/format changes
    - Standard Repo has Fortinet reLearn theme Variant & all necessary customizations
  - Swap in Hugo ReLearn theme (actively community supported) and eliminate Learn & Notice themes (inactive development)
  - Ubuntu container:
    - Maintain consistent Hugo version and eliminate need for local installs
    - allow continuous improvement to our process via container improvements without adding burden to CSE Team
  - Use Container for Hugo Build & GitHub action to publish/refresh GitHub Pages
  - Containerizing our development efforts allows for a lightweight development area while eliminating redundant componentry every time we create a new repo/workshop/demo, and allowing simple and automated updates to existing workshops when the parent template changes.
       - Ultimately we'd like to have scripting copy/revise parent templates periodically and/or whenever we create new Workshops  
  - First TECWorkshop re-published with this new workflow: https://fortinetcloudcse.github.io/FortiCNF/
- MVP 0.2
  - created FortiCloudCSE GitHub Org
  - begin separation of UserRepo & Central Repo
  - begin investigation into container workflow
- MVP 0.1
  - Single repo, manual copy of theme, no use of submodules
  - Introduce Hugo, Learn theme & first draft at Learn theme Variant
  - Use GitHub action to build and Publish to Pages
  - First TECWorkshop published: https://fortinetsecdevops.github.io/technical-recipe-azure-sdwan/

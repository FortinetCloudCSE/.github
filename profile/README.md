- MVP 1.1 - June 2023
    - reduce container size (using Alpine to get shell.  BusyBox does not have shell)
    - autopublish action on GitHub (run our container as GitHub action to perform Hugo build w/ CentralRepo)
      - eliminates need to store Hugo static HTML (autopublish action directly publishes to GH pages)
    - Move Shortcodes from CentralRepo to UserRepo
    - Add CentralRepo/scripts/local_copy.sh to copy any local shortcodes or partials into container
    - Modify logo.html to read Params for logoBanner & logoBannerColor
    - Standardize themes and colors for Workshop, UseCase, Spotlight, Demo
    - Modify Banner Text and Subtext to match theme and be customizable 
    - Add ability to run container run in "build", "server", or "shell" mode
    - Added Dev container env & workflow to stage and test changes before promoting to main/Prod
- MVP 1.0 - May 2023
  - Separated UserRepo and Central Repo to allow maximum re-usability & future-proofing for style/format changes
    - Standard Repo has Fortinet reLearn theme Variant & all necessary customizations
  - Swap in Hugo ReLearn theme (actively community supported) and eliminate Learn & Notice themes (inactive development)
  - Ubuntu container:
    - Maintain consistent Hugo version and eliminate need for local installs
    - allow continuous improvement to our process via container improvements without adding burden to CSE Team
  - Use Container for Hugo Build & GitHub action to publish/refresh GitHub Pages
  - Containerizing our development efforts allows for a lightweight development area while eliminating redundant componentry every time we create a new repo/workshop/demo, and allowing simple and automated updates to existing workshops when the parent template changes.
       - Ultimately we'd like to have scripting copy/revise parent templates periodically and/or whenever we create new Workshops  
  - First TECWorkshop re-published with this new workflow: https://fortinetcloudcse.github.io/FortiCNF/
- MVP 0.2
  - created FortiCloudCSE GitHub Org
